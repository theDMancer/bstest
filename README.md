ZK Crypto Project
License

Welcome to the ZK Crypto Project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for Zero-Knowledge (ZK) cryptography. By leveraging ZK cryptography, we can achieve secure and private computations without revealing sensitive data. This README will guide you through the project's setup, features, and usage.

Features
Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Provides a collection of algorithms and protocols for generating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs.
Cryptography: Implements various cryptographic primitives, such as symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, hash functions, digital signatures, and more.
Secure Computation: Offers tools for secure multiparty computation (MPC) and secure function evaluation (SFE) using zero-knowledge techniques.
Privacy-Preserving Protocols: Includes a set of privacy-preserving protocols like private set intersection, secure data sharing, and secure multi-party computation.
Usage
To use the ZK Crypto Project in your own application, follow these steps:

Import the required modules into your code:

python
Copy code
from zk_crypto import proofs, cryptography, secure_computation
Use the available functions and classes according to your requirements. Refer to the project's documentation for detailed usage instructions.

Build and run your application.

For detailed usage examples, please check the examples folder in the repository.
